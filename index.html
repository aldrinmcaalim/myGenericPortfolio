        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello there, my name is Aldrin. I'm the editor for <span>Probaby
          Programming</span> as well as a writer for <span>Level Up Coding</span> and <span>The
          Startup</span>. All three are publications found on Medium. I enjoy sharing
          the knowledge I have gained with others through this platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time I tried programming I was 18. I struggled to build up
          the habit, mostly due to the feeling of being a fraud. I thought to
          myself that this isn't for me, it's only for those with a computer
          science background. Every now and then my itch to program ignited. I'd
          got a week or two when the feeling of being a fraud hit me again. Then
          at the age of 21, I decided to set a goal to commit myself to
          programming daily, even if I felt like a fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first program was a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. That's the first
          time I felt like I could do this. And now I've just been consistently
          building my skills, mostly by learning <span>JavaScript</span>. I've enjoyed the
          journey, whether I'm writing code, reading about code or writing about
          code. <span>Each day I get to learn something new and enjoy sharing that
          with others</span>. My new goal is to land a full-time job where I can help a
          company hit their goals.
