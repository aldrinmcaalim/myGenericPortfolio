        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello there, my name is Aldrin. I'm the editor for "Probaby
          Programming" as well as a writer for "Level Up Coding" and "The
          Startup". All three are publications found on Medium. I enjoy sharing
          the knowledge I have gained with others through this platform. The
          first time I tried programming I was 18. I struggled to build up the
          habit, mostly due to the feeling of being a fraud. I thought to myself
          that this isn't for me, it's only for those with a computer science
          background. Every now and then my itch to program ignited. I'd got a
          week or two when the feeling of being a fraud hit me again. Then at
          the age of 21, I decided to set a goal to commit myself to programming
          daily, even if I felt like a fraud. My first program was a Rock,
          Paper, Scissors game. That's the first time I felt like I could do
          this. And now I've just been consistently building my skills, mostly
          by learning JavaScript. I've enjoyed the journey, whether I'm writing
          code, reading about code or writing about code. Each day I get to
          learn something new and enjoy sharing that with others. My new goal is
          to land a full-time job where I can help a company hit their goals.
