        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Hello there, my name is Aldrin. I'm the editor for
          <span>Probably Programming</span> as well as a writer for
          <span>Level Up Coding</span> and <span>The Startup</span>. All three
          are publications found on Medium. I enjoy sharing the knowledge I have
          gained with others through this platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time I tried programming at 18. I struggled to build up the
          habit because I felt like a fraud. I believed that this wasn't for
          someone like me, it's only for those with a computer science
          background. But now and then my itch to program ignited. I'd give
          programming a go for a week or two until the feeling of being a fraud
          hit me again. Then at 21, I decided to set a goal to commit myself to
          programming daily, even if I felt like a fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ended up making a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. That was the first
          time I felt like I could do this. And now I've just been consistently
          building my skills, mostly by learning <span>JavaScript</span>. I've
          enjoyed the journey, whether I'm writing code, reading about code, or
          writing about code.
          <span
            >Now each day I get to learn something new about the topic I love
            while also being able to share it with others</span
          >. My new goal is to land a full-time job where I can help a company
          hit their goals.
